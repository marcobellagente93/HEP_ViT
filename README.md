## Visual Transformer for jet images classification

Code is inspired by [vit-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch), a Pytorch version of the original [Jax repository](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer)

The data folder only contains a tiny example of 2k images for training and validation, please refer to the TopTagging dataset [TopTagging dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2603256#.YRUtOi2Q1p8) for training on the full 1.2M data set.

## Notebooks

We provide a notebook to illustrate the technique
